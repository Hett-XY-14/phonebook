Phonebook is a microapp project built to practice what I've learnt following the Helsinski's University FullStackOpen course. 
It was developed using the following stack:
    ---| Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS and REACT JS; 
    ---| Backend: NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, it runs in a Heroku server; 
    ---| Database: MongoDB; 
    ---| Relevant: RESTful API,  Git, Bash commands, Postman.
